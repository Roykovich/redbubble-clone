# Simple Redbubble Clone

This is a project that I made in order to practice my skills so I decided to copy the interface of Redbubble, an e-commerce webpage where you can buy many products made community artists.

## Components

### **The Navbar**

It has flexbox for the responsiveness, media queries for smaller devices, navigation buttons with visual hierarchy and custom buttons with font awesome icons pack.
